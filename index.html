		<h1> How to participate ? </h1>
		<p>
			Once you finish to play a two against two game, fill-up the <a href="https://ee-eu.kobotoolbox.org/x/kznJGxQo">form</a>. The results will be recalculated and published whenever I fill like it, with no garantee of this being regular or reactive. Raw results (without ranking calculations) will be uploaded unregularly in <a href="data.html">Games</a>. <b>Only submit once per game ! Be careful to write your name correctly and consistently !</b>
		</p>

		<h1> How does the individual ranking works ? </h1>
		<p>
			A homemade elo system that works for a 2vs2 game. Based on his post : <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/838809/rating-system-for-2-vs-2-2-vs-1-and-1-vs-1-game"> https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/838809/rating-system-for-2-vs-2-2-vs-1-and-1-vs-1-game </a>.

			If you are curious, go read the code on my github.
		</p>

		<h1> How does the team ranking works ? </h1>
		<p>
			Each team provide a partial ranking of the teams by looking at its average score against each team. A genetic algorithm is used to approximate a ranking that minimizes the collisions with all partial rankings. As I'm too lazy to give details, you can read my code. It's public after all. <b>Two players are considered a team and ranked only after playing 4 games together. Each connected subset of teams will have its own ranking.</b>
		</p>

		<h1> What if you did something wrong ? </h1>
		<p>
		The non-exaustive list being:
		</p>
		 <ul>
		  <li>Submitting several times for the same game.</li>
		  <li>Submitting wrong informations.</li>
		  <li>Not writing your name correctly (shame on you).</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>
			If this happens, you can contact me on the whatsapp group of this tournament or my email. I might or might not help you depending on my mood.
		</p>
